			Dr. Patwari was a man with versatile qualities. Apart from being an academician, he was a humanist, philanthropist and a successful entrepreneur. He was introvert in nature and did not like to be exposed. Professor Patwari is such a personality that for those who know him, no words are necessary and for those who do not know him, no words will suffice. He is sorely missed by those who knew him. He is in the heart of Dhaka International University (DIU) family and he cannot be forgotten and we always find him in our existence. Let us all pray for his departed soul.
